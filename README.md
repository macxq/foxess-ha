## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & ‚ôªÔ∏è Update

Use hacs.io to manage the installation and update process. Right now this integration is part of HACS by default - no more neeed to add it by custom repositories ü•≥

## ‚å®Ô∏è Manual installation 

Create the folder called `foxess` in `/homeassistant/custom_components`

Copy the content of this integrations `custom_components/foxess` folder into your HA `/homeassistant/custom_components/foxess` folder



## üíæ Configuration

Edit your home-assistant `/configuration.yaml`  and add:

```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: foxess
    deviceID: enter_your_inverter_id
    deviceSN: enter_your_inverter_serial_number
    apiKey: enter_your_personal_api_key
```

#### Auxiliary notes:
- `username & password` are no longer required for this integration, it uses your_personal_api_key instead.

- `your_inverter_serial_number` is the serial number of the inverter this integration will be gathering data from, you can see the deviceSN by logging into the Foxesscloud.com website, in the left hand menu click on 'Device', then 'Inverter' this will display a table and your Inverter SN - the format will be similar to : 60BHnnnnnnXnnn - copy and paste this into the config setting deviceSN: replacing the text `foxesscloud_inverter_serial_number`

- `your_personal_api_key` is a personal api_key that is generated in your profile selection of your Foxesscloud account. To do this log into the Foxesscloud.com website, click on the 'profile icon' in the top right corner and select 'User Profile'. Then on the menu on the left hand side select 'API Management' and click 'Generate API Key, the long string that it generates should be copied and pasted into the platform config setting of your configuration.yaml apiKey: replacing the text `foxesscloud_personal_api_key` (see example above).

- `your_inverter_id` in UUID that can be found on the foxesscloud in the url path on the `Inverter Details` page.
‚ö†Ô∏è  Please make sure that this is exact value from inverter details page address between = and & character:

- Multi-inverter support - if you have more than one FoxESS device in your installation, you can leverage the optional `name` field in your config,
   ```
   sensor:
     - platform: foxess
       name: Fox1
       deviceID: enter_your_inverter_id_1
       deviceSN: enter_your_inverter_serial_number_1
       apiKey: enter_your_personal_api_key_1
     - platform: foxess
       name: Fox2
       deviceID: enter_your_inverter_id_2
       deviceSN: enter_your_inverter_serial_number_2
       apiKey: enter_your_personal_api_key_2
   ```

## ü§î Troubleshooting 

API Error summary:

- `{"errno":41930,"result":null}` ‚ü∂ incorrect inverter id
- `{"errno":40261,"result":null}` ‚ü∂ incorrect inverter id
- `{"errno":41807,"result":null}` ‚ü∂ wrong user name or password
- `{"errno":41808,"result":null}` ‚ü∂ token expired
- `{"errno":41809,"result":null}` ‚ü∂ invalid token
- `{"errno":40256,"result":null}` ‚ü∂ Request header parameters are missing. Check whether the request headers are consistent with OpenAPI requirements.
- `{"errno":40257,"result":null}` ‚ü∂ Request body parameters are invalid. Check whether the request body is consistent with OpenAPI requirements.
- `{"errno":40400,"result":null}` ‚ü∂ The number of requests is too frequent. Please reduce the frequency of access.


Increase log level in your `/configuration.yaml` by adding:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.foxess: debug
```

## FoxESS Open API Access and Limits
FoxESS provide an OpenAPI that allows registered users to make request to return datasets.

The OpenAPI access is limited and each user must have a personal_api_key to access it, this personal_api_key can be generated by logging into the FoxESS cloud wesbite - then click on the Profile Icon in the top right hand corner of the screen, select User Profile and then from the menu select API Management, click the button to 'Generate API Key' - this long string of numbers is your personal_api_key and must be used for access to your systems details.

The OpenAPI has a limit of 1,440 API calls per day, after which the OpenAPI will stop responding to requests and generate a "40400" error.

This sounds like a large number of calls, but bear in mind that multiple API calls have to be made on each scan to gain the complete dataset for a system.

The integration paces the number of API calls that are made, currently getting all real time sensor information every 5 minutes (in-line with the datalogger update frequency). The report information that provides the current 'daily' figures for Feedin, Generation, GridConsumption, Battery Charge, Battery Discharge and Load, the Energy Generated (todays yield) and the battery settings are read every 15 minutes and on the hour.

As it stands the integration is using approximately 40 API calls an hour (960 a day and well within the 1,440), there are some outstanding requests on FoxESS R&D that could reduce this further and hopefully in future allow faster updates.
